Welcome to VizELISA 1.1.3!

This program is designed to process and visualize ELISA glycan array data. 
The program is split into 4 sections:
	* Data Input
			- this is where instructions and links to important files can be found. You may also validate their data to make sure the formatting is correct.
	* Quick Parameters
			- this section allows for the quick use of checkboxes for you to indicate preferences such as outlier removal or bolding of figure titles.
	* Graph Specifications
			- this section allows the user to manually enter/change values relating to the physical characteristics of the output figures.
	* Standard output
			- this section houses Python's standard output and updates/errors will be given here along every step of the analysis.

1) Change all the parameters necessary for the final heatmap output. This will be under Data Input and Quick Parameters. You may validate your data here (optional).
2) Click the Load Files button under Quick Parameters. This will extract the numerical information from all files in the "data" folder. Common errors will be met with advice on how to solve it.
3) Adjust the parameters as required under Graph Specifications.
4) Click on the Confirm Parameters button. This will generate a low-resolution figure (as a pop-up) for you to evaluate chosen parameters. Note: close the pop-up before returning to VizELISA, or else risk the program crashing.
